# Lloyd's algorithm, but in the GPU
This is [Lloyd's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) implemented with [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API). The implementation is similar to the one used in the [Swingline Voronoi Stippling Library](https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/swingline/).

# What is Lloyd's algorithm?
I'm glad you asked! Lloyd's algorithm is a method for finding evenly spaced points within a Euclidean subplane by iteratively constructing [Voroni diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) which partition a subset of the plane into regions called "cells" or "Voronoi cells."  Each cell comprises the coordinates closest to the point inside it. Here's an example of a Voronoi diagram of 100 random points on a plane (*points on a plane*, is that a joke?). The cells are color-coded for clarity:

For an example of a practical application, imagine the dots represent items on a screen and you want to highlight the item closest to the userâ€™s mouse. In this scenario, you can render a hidden Voronoi diagram and highlight an dot when the mouse is over that dot's respective cell.  If you want to know more about Voronoi Diagrams, I suggest reading Francesco S. Bellelli's excellent article [The fascinating world of Voronoi diagrams](https://fbellelli.com/posts/2021-07-08-the-fascinating-world-of-voronoi-diagrams/).

Lloyd's algorithm operates through a series of steps aimed at making increasingly more uniform Voronoi cells.Those steps are as follows:

1. Start with an initial set of points, distributed randomly within the target space
1. Create a Voronoi diagram around those points
1. Calculate the centroid (geometric center) of each cell.
1. Move each point to the centroid of its cell
1. Repeat steps 2 through 5

With each iteration the distance between a point and the centroid of its cell diminishes and the diagram converges to a mesh of relatively uniform cells, like the one pictured at the top of this article.
